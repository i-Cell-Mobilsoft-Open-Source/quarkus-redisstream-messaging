== Introduction

This project provides a *Redis Stream*-based *SmallRye Reactive Messaging* connector that enables the use of the *MicroProfile Reactive Messaging API* over Redis Stream.
The implementation allows seamless integration of asynchronous data streams into WildFly and Quarkus-based applications.

== Project Structure

This repository consists of the following main components:

=== RedisStream Connector

A *Reactive Messaging connector* compatible with WildFly that handles Redis Stream-based data flows.
Similar to existing connectors (Kafka, AMQP, etc.), this can be configured without needing to manage the underlying implementation manually.

=== Quarkus Extension

For easy integration with Quarkus, the connector is also available as a Quarkus extension.
This extension helps with configuration and optimizes the runtime environment.
The extension consists of two main parts:

- *Runtime*: Contains components required during application execution.
- *Deployment*: Handles configuration aspects needed at build time.

=== Quarkus Sample

A sample application demonstrating how to use the extension with Quarkus.
This project shows how to configure and use the Redis Stream connector in practice.

== Usage

The RedisStream connector can be configured using MicroProfile Config properties.
The following example demonstrates a simple producer-consumer setup:

.microprofile-config.properties
[source,properties]
----
mp.messaging.incoming.my-stream.connector=redis-stream
mp.messaging.incoming.my-stream.channel=my-channel

mp.messaging.outgoing.my-stream.connector=redis-stream
mp.messaging.outgoing.my-stream.channel=my-channel
----

You can test the solution by running the sample project.

== Requirements

- Java 17+
- Maven 3.8.1+
- Redis 6+

Can use it in:

- Wildfly
- Quarkus (with the extension)
