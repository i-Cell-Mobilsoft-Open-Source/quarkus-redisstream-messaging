= Connector overview

The connector core module aims to integrate the Redis Streams API with the Reactive Messaging Specification without depending on a specific Redis SDK.

== Consuming Messages

The inbound connector reads messages from a Redis Stream as a consumer group using the https://redis.io/docs/latest/commands/xreadgroup/[`XREADGROUP`] command.

=== Consumer Group Setup

* If the specified consumer group does not exist, it is automatically created.
* Each connector instance uses a unique consumer ID (UUID) to track message processing.

=== Incoming Message

Incoming stream entries are converted to `org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Message` instances with a String payload and `IncomingRedisStreamMetadata` metadata.

* The payload is extracted from the stream entries' `message` field by default.
** The field can be configured via the `payload-field` configuration property (Optional).
* `IncomingRedisStreamMetadata` consists of:
** The stream key from which the message was read.
** Stream entry ID (as generated on Redis).
** All additional fields (excluding the payload-field) in a map.

=== Message Processing

* Stream entries are acknowledged on Redis using (https://redis.io/docs/latest/commands/xack/[`XACK`]) if the `org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Message` has been acked as per the Microprofile Reactive Messaging specification.
You can use the `@Acknowledgment` annotation to control the acknowledgment behavior.
* Expired messages (based on the `ttl` field) are automatically acknowledged and skipped.
* `XREADGROUP` commands are retried with exponential backoff (1s to 30s) on processing failures.

==== Example Configuration

[source,properties]
----
mp.messaging.incoming.my-channel.connector=reactive-messaging-redis-streams #<1>
mp.messaging.incoming.my-channel.stream-key=mystream #<2>
mp.messaging.incoming.my-channel.group=mygroup #<3>
mp.messaging.incoming.my-channel.payload-field=message #<4>
mp.messaging.incoming.my-channel.xread-count=10 #<5>
mp.messaging.incoming.my-channel.xread-block-ms=10000 #<6>
mp.messaging.incoming.in-reactive.xread-noack=false #<7>
----

<1> Activate the redis stream connector for the incoming channel called `my-channel`.
<2> The stream key on redis to read messages from.
<3> The consumer group name.
<4> The field name to extract the payload from the stream entry.
<5> The number of messages to read in a single `XREADGROUP` call.
The `COUNT` parameter of the `XREADGROUP` command.
<6> The milliseconds to block during `XREADGROUP` calls.
The `BLOCK` parameter of the `XREADGROUP` command.
<7> Include `NOACK` option in the `XREADGROUP` calls.

== Producing Messages

The outbound connector publishes messages to a Redis Stream using https://redis.io/docs/latest/commands/xadd/[`XADD`].

=== Outgoing Message

Outgoing `org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Message` instances with a String payload are converted to stream entries.

* The payload is sent as the stream entries' `message` field by default.
** The field can be configured via the `payload-field` configuration property (Optional).
* Additional fields can be added via `RedisStreamMetadata`.

[source,java]
----
@Outgoing("out-channel")
public Message<String> produce() {
    return Message.of("Hello World!")
        .addMetadata(new RedisStreamMetadata()
                            .withAdditionalField("additionalKey", "additional value")
        );
//    The produced stream entry will be like:
//      1) 1) "out-stream"
//         2) 1) 1) "1739262584638-0"
//            2) 1) "message"
//               2) "Hello World!"
//               3) "additionalKey"
//               4) "Test-additional value"
}

=== Stream Trimming

* Use `xadd-maxlen` to trim by entry count (`MAXLEN` parameter of the `XADD` command).
** Exact trimming can be enabled by setting `xadd-exact-maxlen` to `true` (defaults to false since almost exact is more efficient).
* Use `xadd-ttl-ms` to compute an expiration timestamp
** Adds a `ttl` field with a value of (current epoch time + TTL), in order to consumers be able to skip expired messages.
** It also sets a minimum ID for stream trimming (`MINID` parameter of the `XADD` command).
* If both are set, `xadd-maxlen` takes precedence.

==== Example Configuration

[source,properties]

mp.messaging.outgoing.out-channel.connector=reactive-messaging-redis-streams #<1>
mp.messaging.outgoing.out-channel.stream-key=mystream #<2>
mp.messaging.incoming.out-channel.payload-field=message #<3>
mp.messaging.outgoing.out-channel.xadd-maxlen=1000 #<4>
mp.messaging.outgoing.out-channel.xadd-exact-maxlen=true #<5>
#mp.messaging.outgoing.out-channel.xadd-ttl-ms=1000 #<6>
----

<1> Activate the redis stream connector for the incoming channel called `my-channel`.
<2> The stream key on redis to read messages from.
<3> The field name to use as the payload in the stream entry.
<4> The maximum number of entries to keep in the stream.
<5> Enable exact trimming by entry count.
<6> Possible trimming based on milliseconds to set the TTL for the stream entry.

== Graceful Shutdown

On shutdown:

* New message consumption stops immediately.
* In-flight messages are given up to `graceful-timeout-ms` (default: 60000ms) to complete.
* Redis connections are closed after timeout or all messages are processed.

Configure the timeout via:
